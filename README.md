# **AI IN HIGHER EDUCATION**

## **THE HIGHER EDUCATION LANDSCAPE**
The Educational Services sector in the U.S. encompasses a wide range of institutions, from public schools to specialized training centers, spread across 13 subsectors. Primary, secondary, and postsecondary institutions dominate this sector, generating 94% of its total revenue. Public schools and universities account for nearly three-quarters of the revenue, thanks largely to government funding. This strong financial backing, alongside rising disposable income, has contributed to the sector's growth. However, recent inflation has begun to strain private school affordability. <sup>[1](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/education-sector/)</sup>

Globally, education and training spending totals about $5.6 trillion annually, including contributions from governments, the private sector, families, and individuals. The global higher education market size alone was $739 billion in 2023. It is estimated to be $828.85 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach around $2.3 trillion by 2033, expanding at a CAGR of 12.14% from 2024 to 2033. The rising developments in the educational sector across the world are driving the growth of the higher education market. The North America higher education market represents the largest revenue share in 2023 at 34% or $251 billion. <sup>[2](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/higher-education-market)</sup>

Colleges and Universities continue to face many compounding financial pressures in the rapidly changing higher education environment. According to a 2023 survey by Syntellis Performance Solutions of more than 100 U.S. higher education finance professionals, the projected drop in potential first-time, full-time enrollment was the top challenge expected to have the greatest financial impact on colleges and universities in the next 5-10 years. Known as the enrollment cliff or demographic cliff, colleges and universities expect declines starting about 2025, attributed to a significant drop in children born during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. <sup>[3](https://www.syntellis.com/sites/default/files/2023-01/2023%20Higher%20Ed%20CFO%20Outlook_HE.1023.01.23%20%281%29.pdf)</sup>

## **AI IN HIGHER EDUCATION**
The rise of generative AI, particularly since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, has caused significant disruption across sectors, including higher education. ChatGPT's rapid adoption, with 100 million users in two months <sup>4</sup> showcased its transformative impact. In a Microsoft WorkLab podcast, Microsoft’s chief scientific officer, Eric Horvits, observed that, _“The next 25 years will be known as the period where we started to work with machines in a way that accelerates human thinking and capabilities.”_ <sup>5</sup>

AI is now prompting institutions to rethink its applications, though most educators and administrators believe they are unprepared for the changes AI will bring. In higher education, generative AI has the potential to enhance human decision-making and improve efficiency in areas like curriculum development, operations, and routine tasks. <sup>[6](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/latest-trends-in-higher-education.html)</sup>

Adoption of AI in higher education has been increasing significantly, driven by the need to enhance learning experiences, optimize operations, and improve outcomes. Some key trends include:
- Personalized Learning
- AI-Powered Tutoring
- Automated Grading and Feedback
- Predictive Analytics
- Smart Classrooms
- AI-Driven Research Tools
- Administrative Efficiency
- Virtual and Augmented Reality

## **RECOMMENDATIONS**
Liaison International should consider expanding its services to assist academic partners with financial aid allocation and enrollment forecasting. As colleges and universities face growing financial pressures and heightened competition for students, effective management of financial aid is critical in attracting and retaining a diverse student body. Offering advanced tools and data-driven insights into financial aid allocation would empower institutions to optimize their resources, making higher education more accessible and affordable for students. Additionally, expanding into enrollment forecasting would help institutions better predict and manage student numbers, allowing for more informed decisions on admissions, budgeting, and resource allocation. By integrating these services into its already robust admissions and enrollment management platform, Liaison can provide an even more comprehensive solution that addresses key institutional challenges, positioning itself as an indispensable partner in higher education.

Expanding into the areas of financial aid allocation and enrollment forecasting can be done by leveraging on the various technologies already in use such as:

- Cloud-Based Platforms

  To integrate data from multiple sources, such as institutional databases, government financial aid programs (e.g., FAFSA), and third-party systems. 

- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

  Integrations with external financial aid systems, student information systems (SIS), and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms, ensuring data flow and synchronization across platforms.

- Data Analytics and Machine Learning

  Machine learning algorithms will be critical for developing accurate enrollment forecasting models. These models can analyze historical data, demographic trends, student behaviors, and external factors to predict future enrollment patterns.

  Advanced data analytics can be used to design models that allocate financial aid based on factors such as student need, academic performance, and likelihood of retention or graduation.

- Artificial Intelligence for Predictive Analytics

  AI can assist in making recommendations for optimizing financial aid packages based on institutional goals (e.g., diversity, academic excellence).

  Automating routine processes such as financial aid distribution, eligibility checks, and document processing can save time and reduce errors.
